# raspPiHVAC
This was my final project for my Processor Hardware/Software Interfaces course. It is meant to simulate a simple HVAC using a Raspberry Pi. <br>
Some aditional hardware is required:
<ul>
    <li>3 push buttons</li>
    <li>3 LEDs (red, blue, and green)</li>
    <li>1 DHT-11 Temp/Humid Sensor</li>
    <li>1 I2C LCD Display</li>
    <li>1 PIR Motion Sensor</li>
    <li>7 Resistors</li>
    </ul>
You will also need to create an account with the CIMIS website and generate an API key in order to get the humidity information.
